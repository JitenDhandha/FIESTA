FIESTA
=====================
*Version: 0.1.0*

**FIESTA** stands for **FI**\ lam\ **E**\ ntary **ST**\ ructure
**A**\ nalysis, and is an astrophysical toolkit for studying filamentary
networks in density fields defined on unstructured meshes. It is
primarily built for use with the multi-physics hydrodynamical code AREPO
(`Springel, 2010 <https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2966.2009.15715.x>`__)
and the filament identification tool DisPerSE (`Sousbie,
2011 <https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2966.2011.18394.x>`__), but can
also be used more generally with other softwares through some
modifications. It includes tools such as: 1. reading and writing data
files for the aforementioned softwares; 2. 2D and 3D visualizations of
simulations and filamentary networks, along with functions for
statistical analysis; 3. algorithms for characterizing filament
properties such as length, mass, density profile, and more!

Bugs and suggestions
--------------------

The code initially started as part of the Masters project “*Beads on a
string: Connecting Turbulence to Massive Star Formation*” at the Jodrell
Bank Center for Astrophysics (JBCA), University of Manchester by Jiten
Dhandha and Zoe Faes under the supervision of Dr. Rowan Smith.

If you have find any bugs, have suggestions or requests, or want help
with the toolkit, please feel free to send one of the authors a message
or raise an issue in the GitHub repository. We would be delighted to
talk about it!
