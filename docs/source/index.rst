FIESTA
==================

**FIESTA** stands for **FI**\ lam\ **E**\ ntary **ST**\ ructure **A**\ nalysis, and is an astrophysical toolkit for studying filamentary networks in density fields defined on unstructured meshes. It is primarily built for use with the multi-physics hydrodynamical code AREPO (`Springel, 2010 <https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2966.2009.15715.x>`_) and the filament identification tool DisPerSE (`Sousbie, 2011 <https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2966.2011.18394.x>`_), but can also be used more generally with other softwares through some modifications. It includes tools such as:

1. reading and writing data files for the aforementioned softwares; 
2. 2D and 3D visualizations of simulations and filamentary networks, along with functions for statistical analysis;
3. algorithms for characterizing filament properties such as length, mass, density profile, and more!
