Introduction
==================

This code initially started as part of the Masters project "*Beads on a string: Connecting Turbulence to Massive Star Formation*" at the Jodrell Bank Center for Astrophysics (JBCA), University of Manchester by Jiten Dhandha (jitendhandha@gmail.com) and Zoe Faes (zoe.faes@esa.int) under the supervision of Dr. Rowan Smith (rowan.smith@manchester.ac.uk). It has been developed over the course of a year, almost entirely from scratch, so we hope it finds some use in the astrophysics community! :\)

Installation
----------------------

FIESTA can be easily installed or upgraded using the following pip commands \(NON FUNCTIONAL CURRENTLY\)::
   
   pip install fiesta
   pip install --upgrade fiesta

To install directly from the GitHub repository, download the zip file and run the following command in the top level directory::
   
   pip install .

This might be useful for those wanting to modify the source code or add their own functionality locally!
