# FIESTA
_Version: Pre-release_

**FIESTA** stands for **FI**lam**E**ntary **ST**ructure **A**nalysis, and is an astrophysical toolkit for studying filamentary networks in density fields defined on unstructured meshes. It is primarily built for use with the multi-physics hydrodynamical code AREPO ([Springel, 2010](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2966.2009.15715.x)) and the filament identification tool DisPerSE ([Sousbie, 2011](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2966.2011.18394.x)), but can also be used more generally with other softwares through some modifications. It includes tools such as:
1. Reading and writing data files for the aforementioned softwares; 
2. 2D and 3D visualizations of simulations and filamentary networks, along with functions for statistical analysis;
3. algorithms for characterizing filament properties such as length, mass, density profile and more.

The code initially started as part of the Masters project <i>"Beads on a string: Connecting Turbulence to Massive Star Formation"</i> at the Jodrell Bank Center for Astrophysics (JBCA), University of Manchester by Jiten Dhandha and Zoe Faes under the supervision of Dr. Rowan Smith.
